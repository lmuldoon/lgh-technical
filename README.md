## Database structure

#### on_rent

- Contains dummy product rental data for a single company over the course of 30 days.
- No timestamps are stored in this table
- Weekly value will never match the SUM of contract values related to each header line due to randomised data.

#### on_rent_lines

- Contains multiple dummy contract data lines linked to each entry in the on_rent table
- Foreign Key linked to id in the on_rent table is **header_id**
- The SUM of Contract values in this table will never match the weekly value for the related header_id (given its all random data)

## The Task

### Scenario

Orders are down compared to average for this time of year due to recent events and management need to see at a glance how the business is performing in terms of current contracts, daily quotes and weekly hire amounts.

    Your task is to write a report which will help them make decisions required to keep the business afloat.

#### Required:

- How many contracts and quotes were generated each day within the last 3 weeks. (bar)
- The weekly hire value (line)
- Show dates in dd/mm/YYYY format on the X axis;
- Show appropriate Y Axis for each bar/line of the chart.

#### Bonus:

- Calculate and show as a line, the moving average of weekly hire.

### Part 2: Generate tabular data

#### Required

- Generate a table under the chart showing the same data in tabular format.

#### Bonus

- Provide the ability to view the contracts (onrent_lines table) for each date in tabular format via a modal / popup.

        Once finished, commit your work and push

### Part 3: Feature Request (Optional)

- Create a new sub branch of your branch
- Add a feature of your choice to the report that you feel would be beneficial to management.
